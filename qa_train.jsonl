Next, these secondary methods are explained:\n 1. Method of the transaction value of identical merchandise: This method is used when the customs value of the imported goods can be determined using the main method, and is based on the transaction value of identical goods imported in the same period, That is, identical merchandise that has really been imported from the same country of origin to Ecuador, and in a time as close to the date of purchase of the product that is being valued. It is taken into account that the merchandise with which it is being compared, has the same characteristics, same commercial level, same purchase amounts. If any of these differs, the necessary value adjustments will be made.\n 2. Method of the transaction value of similar goods: This method is used when the customs value of imported goods can be determined using the main method or the identical goods method, and is based on the transaction value of similar goods transaction imported in the same period. It is considered for comparative purposes, goods that keep similar characteristics, to the same commercial level, in the same quantities, which serve for the same purpose and can be commercially interchangeable. As in the previous case, if not the same quantities or the same commercial level, adjustments can be made in the value to be comparable.\n 3. Deductive value method: This method is used when the above methods cannot be used. For this method, the unit price is taken to be sold in the same conditions in the import country, the largest number of imported goods or other imported goods that are identical or similar to them, at the time of import of the goods subject to valuation, or at an approximate time up to 90 days, to people who are not linked, deducting international transportation expenses, transport insurance, customs taxes, and local expenses that were generated after the Dinuanization.\n 4. Assessment method based on rebuilt value: This method is used when the above methods cannot be used, and is based on the cost of production of imported goods, including material costs, labor and other expenses, as well as the user's usefulness. At the request of the importer, customs can invest the order of application and first apply this method instead of first applying the deductive value method, if the supports are available to apply the reconstructed value method.\n 5. Valuation method \"Last resort\": It is a secondary method of customs assessment that is used when it is not possible to determine the customs value of the imported goods using any of the other available valuation methods. This method is based on a determination of the customs value of the imported goods, using the available information and applying the customs valuation criteria that fit the circumstances of the case, that is, the methods of customs valuation with greater flexibility are evaluated again in order to value merchandise.\nQuestion: 1.
